This houses all my personal work and ideas being put together! 
My first project is an application which simulates a banking ATM service, which allows a registered user to make deposit and withdrawal into and from an account.
The account is created at the time of registration on the application, subsequently, a deposit is made after which a withdrawal can follow. 
This project demonstrates data integrity within and application and for each transaction made by a user it is stored in the database. 
When a user click on history button on the App, it fetches transaction history from the database for individual client if such individual have any transaction within the database 
otherwise no history is fetched To complete a transaction, a user needs to close the App when done with overall transaction.
